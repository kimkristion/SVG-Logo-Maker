# SVG Logo Maker

## Overview
An interactive command-line application that uses user input to formulate a customized SVG logo

## Description 
- The main incentive for developing this application was to use command-line prompts to provide a simple way for users to generate a custom SVG logo that applies custom parameters an outputs a file in seconds.
- This application harnesses inquirer for user interaction and fs to effortlessly generate SVG files, encapsulating the user's custom SVG logo.
- In my view, this application serves as a rapid demonstration of my proficiency in JavaScript, with a focus on utilizing module exports and leveraging npm tools to create command-line applications.
- Throughout the development of this application, I had the opportunitiy to further my understanding of class constructors and their utilization in extending functionality into child functions.

## Usage 
Input 'npm i' install all of the needed dependencies, then run 'node index' to begin the prompts. Run 'npm test' to run jest . https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UYoHtZPj6QZZd9cAEVj36KVMJNVOl6CZ/view
